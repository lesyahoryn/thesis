\chapter{Introduction}

Particle physics seeks to understand the fundamental structure of the universe by defining the minimal set of particles required to describe all physical phenomena. The \acf{SM} is the best attempt at such a description. The \ac{SM} has undergone decades of rigorous testing and can explain almost all phenomena we see in experiments, yet it has long been known that the \ac{SM} is missing explanations for essential physical phenomena like quantum description of gravity or a dark matter candidate. As a result, many \acf{BSM} theories have been developed and tested, hoping to extend and complete the picture the \ac{SM} gives. So far, none of these theories have been discovered where physicists expected and hoped they might be.

The \acf{LHC} at \acf{CERN}, a 27 km particle collider outside of Geneva, Switzerland on the border with France, is the largest particle physics experiment in the world, and provides an extremely effective environment to test the \ac{SM} and a wide variety of \ac{BSM} theories. This thesis uses data from the \acf{ATLAS} experiment, one of the four largest experiments along the \ac{LHC} ring designed to measure the results of \ac{LHC} collisions.

Beams of protons circulate and collide in the \ac{LHC}, and if two protons collide with sufficiently high energy, massive particles can be created; $\sqrt{s} = 8 \TeV$ collisions enabled the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson with mass of 125 \GeV. The \ac{LHC} provides 60 million collisions per second, enabling physicists to use the various subdetectors of \ac{ATLAS} are used together search for new and rare physical phenomena. Unfortunately, after 8 years of data taking no evidence of \ac{BSM} physics has been found. Data taking is scheduled to resume in 2022 with only a moderate increase in collision energy and about a factor 2 more data. 

This is a call to re-examine the assumptions made in \ac{BSM} searches that have been performed so far. What could we have missed in our search for new physics at the TeV scale? Most searches are optimized for \ac{BSM} particles that either decay immediately or do not decay in the detector, but this misses a large range of intermediate lifetimes of possible \ac{BSM} particles. These signatures are challenging, but not impossible, to identify with \ac{ATLAS} as they result in displaced \ac{SM} particles. Many \ac{SM} particles are long lived, like muons or neutrons, and many \ac{BSM} theories predict particles with lifetimes that result in displaced decays. This thesis presents a search for one such signature.

This thesis presents a search for two displaced \ac{SM} leptons, either electrons or muons, that are not connected by a displaced vertex. Due to the displacement and lack of vertex, a \ac{BSM} particle decaying to this signature would be vetoed by all other analyses at the \ac{LHC}. This search has unique sensitivity to a specific \acf{GMSB} \acf{SUSY} model where the \acf{LSP} is the superpartner to the graviton, the gravitino, and the \acf{NLSP} is a slepton, the superpartner to a lepton. The slepton is long lived because it relies on the very weak gravitational coupling to the gravitino. The last time this model was explored was in the OPAL experiment at \acf{LEP} \cite{opal}, where masses up to about 90 \GeV were probed for a full range of lifetimes, immediately decaying to detector stable and all possible signatures in between. This search probes almost an order of magnitude of mass phase space in a significantly more challenging environment than \ac{LEP}.

Bespoke particle selection algorithms and robust data-driven background estimates were developed to be able to efficiently probe this uncovered phase space. This search for displaced leptons uses $136 \ifb$ of data collected by \ac{ATLAS} during Run 2 of the \ac{LHC}. Major backgrounds come from fakes of the reconstruction algorithms and muons from cosmic rays. Less than 1 background events are predicted and zero events are seen, and so limits on the mass and lifetime of sleptons in this model are set for the first time at the \ac{LHC}.
